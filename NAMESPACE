The NAMESPACE file specifies the interface to the package that is presented to the user. This is done via a series of export() statements, which indicate which functions in the package are exported to the user. Functions that are not exported cannot be called directly by the user (although see below). In addition to exports, the NAMESPACE file also specifies what functions or packages are imported by the package. If your package depends on functions from another package, you must import them via the NAMESPACE file.

Below is the NAMESPACE file for the mvtsplot package described above.

export("mvtsplot")

import(splines)
import(RColorBrewer)
importFrom("grDevices", "colorRampPalette", "gray")
importFrom("graphics", "abline", "axis", "box", "image", "layout",
           "lines", "par", "plot", "points", "segments", "strwidth",
           "text", "Axis")
importFrom("stats", "complete.cases", "lm", "na.exclude", "predict",
           "quantile")


------------------------
export("netmem")

import("igraph")
importFrom("network", "as.sociomatrix") #  specify exactly which function you need from an external package
