The man sub-directory contains the documentation files for all of the exported objects of a package. With older versions of R one had to write the documentation of R objects directly into the man directory using a LaTeX-style notation. However, with the development of the roxygen2 package, we no longer need to do that and can write the documentation directly into the R code files. Therefore, you will likely have little interaction with the man directory as all of the files in there will be auto-generated by the roxygen2 package.
