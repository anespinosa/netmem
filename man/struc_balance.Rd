\title{Structural balance}
\usage{
struc_balance(A, B = NULL, score = c("triangle", "walk"))
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A signed symmetric matrix (i.e., with ties that are either -1, 0 or 1)}

\item{B}{A signed symmetric matrix considered as the negative ties (i.e., with ties that are either -1, 0 or 1)}

\item{score}{Whether to return the \code{triangle} (default) or \code{walk} balance score (Aref and Wilson, 2017)}
}
\value{
This function return the structural balance (Heider, 1940; Cartwright and Harary, 1956). 
When \code{B} is used, matrix A is considered the negative matrix and \code{A} the positive matrix.

\examples{
A <- matrix(c(0,-1,-1,0,
              -1,0,1,0,
              -1,1,0,0,
              0,0,0,0), byrow = TRUE, ncol = 4)
rownames(A) <- letters[1:nrow(A)]
colnames(A) <- rownames(A)
struc_balance(A)
