# netmem: Network Measures using Matrices

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `netmem` is to make available different measures to describe networks using matrices.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anespinosa/netmem")
```

## Example

### Data

```r
library(netmem)
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
Let's assume that we have a multilevel network with three adjacency matrices and two incident matrices between them.

- `A1`: Adjacency Matrix of the level 1
- `B1`: Incident Matrix between level 1 and level 2
- `A2`: Adjacency Matrix of the level 2
- `B2`: Incident Matrix between level 2 and level 3
- `A3`: Adjacency Matrix of the level 3
</div>

Create the data
```r
A1 <- matrix(c(0,1,0,0,1,
              1,0,0,1,1,
              0,0,0,1,1,
              0,1,1,0,1,
              1,1,1,1,0), byrow=TRUE, ncol=5)
              
B1 <- matrix(c(1,0,0,
              1,1,0,
              0,1,0,
              0,1,0,
              0,1,1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=3)

A2 <- matrix(c(0,1,1,
              1,0,0,
              1,0,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=3)

B2 <- matrix(c(1,1,0,0,
              0,0,1,0,
              0,0,1,1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=4)

A3 <- matrix(c(0,1,1,1,
              1,0,0,0,
              1,0,0,1,
              1,0,1,0), byrow=TRUE, ncol=4)

B3 <- matrix(c(1,0,0,0,0,
              0,1,0,1,0,
              0,0,0,0,0,
              0,0,0,0,0), byrow=TRUE, ncol=5)

```

### Degree centrality

Explore the normalized degree centrality of one of the adjacency matrices and the normalized degree of the bipartite matrices
```r
# Degree centrality of the first matrix
gen_degree(A1, digraph = FALSE, normalized=TRUE)

# Degree centrality of one of the incident matrices
gen_degree(B1, bipartite = TRUE, normalized=TRUE)

```

Now, we can calculate the degree centrality of the entire structure
```r
multilevel_degree(A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3, complete = TRUE)
```

-----

### Census triad

We can also check the triad census assuming conditional uniform distribution considering different types of dyads **(U|MAN)**
```r
triad_uman(A1)
```

-----

### Ego measures

Also, we would calculate the level of the constraint of one particular actor (e.g. actor `5`) 
```r
eb_constraint(A1, ego=5)
```
