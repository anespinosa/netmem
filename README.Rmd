The goal of `netmem` is to make available different measures to describe and manipulate networks using matrices.

The package implements different measures to analyse and manipulate complex multilayer networks, from an ego-centric perspective, considering one-mode networks, valued ties (i.e. *weighted* or *multiplex*) or with multiple levels.

## Multilevel Networks

Connections between individuals are often embedded in complex structures, which shape actorsâ€™ expectations, behaviours and outcomes over time. These structures can themselves be interdependent and exist at different levels. Multilevel networks are a means by which we can represent this complex system by using nodes and edges of different types. Check [this book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319245188) edited by Emmanuel Lazega and Tom A.B. Snijders.

For multilevel structures, we tend to collect the data in different matrices representing the variation of ties within and between levels. Often, we describe the connection between actors as an adjacency matrix and the relations between levels through incident matrices. The comfortable combination of these matrices into a common structure would represent the multilevel network that could be highly complex.

### Example

<div class="alert alert-info">
Let's assume that we have a multilevel network with two adjacency matrices, one valued matrix and two incident matrices between them.

- `A1`: Adjacency Matrix of the level 1
- `B1`: Incident Matrix between level 1 and level 2
- `A2`: Adjacency Matrix of the level 2
- `B2`: Incident Matrix between level 2 and level 3
- `A3`: Valued Matrix of the level 3
- `B3`: Incident Matrix between level 3 and level 1
</div>

Create the data
```{r multilevel_example}
A1 <- matrix(c(0,1,0,0,1,
              1,0,0,1,1,
              0,0,0,1,1,
              0,1,1,0,1,
              1,1,1,1,0), byrow=TRUE, ncol=5)
              
B1 <- matrix(c(1,0,0,
              1,1,0,
              0,1,0,
              0,1,0,
              0,1,1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=3)

A2 <- matrix(c(0,1,1,
              1,0,0,
              1,0,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=3)

B2 <- matrix(c(1,1,0,0,
              0,0,1,0,
              0,0,1,1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=4)

A3 <- matrix(c(0,1,3,1,
              1,0,0,0,
              3,0,0,5,
              1,0,5,0), byrow=TRUE, ncol=4)

B3 <- matrix(c(1,0,0,0,0,
              0,1,0,1,0,
              0,0,0,0,0,
              0,0,0,0,0), byrow=TRUE, ncol=5)
```

### Ego measures

When we are interested in one particular actor, we could perform different network measures. For example, actor `5` has connections with all the other actors in the network. Therefore, we could estimate its constraint.
```{r ego}
eb_constraint(A1, ego=5)
```

-----


### One-mode network

This package implements the generalized degree centrality. Suppose we consider a valued matrix `A3`. If `alpha=0` then it would only count the direct connections. But, adding the tuning parameter `alpha=0.5` would determine the relative importance of the number of ties compared to tie weights. 

```{r onem}
gen_degree(A3, digraph = FALSE, weighted=TRUE)
```

Also, we could conduct some explorative analysis using the normalized degree of an incident matrix.
```{r onem2}
gen_degree(B1, bipartite = TRUE, normalized=TRUE)
```
 
This package also implement some dyadic analysis
```{r onem3}
# Dyadic census
dyadic_census(A1)

# Katz and Powell reciprocity
pkp(A1)

# Z test of the number of arcs
zarc(A1)
```

We can also check the triad census assuming conditional uniform distribution considering different types of dyads **(U|MAN)**
```{r onem4}
triad_uman(A1)
```
 

-----

### Multilevel network

Now, we can calculate the degree centrality of the entire structure
```{r multil, warning=FALSE}
multilevel_degree(A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3, complete = TRUE)
```

Besides, we can perform a *k*-core analysis of one of the levels using the information of an incident matrix
```{r multil2, warning=FALSE}
k_core(A1, B1, multilevel=TRUE)
```

This package also allows performing complex census for multilevel networks.
```{r multil3}
mixed_census(A2, t(B1), B2, quad=TRUE)
```
